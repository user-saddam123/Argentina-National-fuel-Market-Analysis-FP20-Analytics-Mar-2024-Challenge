### Sales Year and Month

The "Sales Year and Month" visual provides valuable insights into car sales trends over different years and months. This visual allows stakeholders to observe sales patterns by year initially, with the flexibility to drill down to specific months within each year for a more detailed analysis.

#### Insight-
Upon analysis, it becomes evident that the **year 2023 witnessed the highest sales**, **totaling 11.04 million pesos**. This sales figure constitutes a significant portion, accounting for 98.08% of the total sales during the specified period. This highlights the remarkable performance of car sales in 2023 compared to other years.

### Is shift type affects the gross total price and average price of fuel?. 
To explore this, a donut charts have been created by me, allowing stakeholders to easily observe the shift-wise gross total sales and average prices.

#### Insight:

Upon analyzing the data, it appears that there is no notable variance in average fuel prices between daytime and nighttime shifts. However, a marginal difference of 0.1% is observed in total sales. Specifically, there were 1430 pesos more sales during the daytime shift compared to the nighttime shift. This suggests that while average prices remain consistent, there is a slight difference in total sales between the two shifts, with daytime sales marginally higher than nighttime sales.

### Sales by flag company, 

visualized using a ZoomChart. This visual enables stakeholders to easily observe the sales generated by each company, with the option to drill down by fuel type.

#### Insight:
